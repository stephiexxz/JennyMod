## Introduction

Jenny Mod is a deeply immersive and surprisingly complex Minecraft sex mod designed to inject a new level of realism and emotional depth into the game. It's not just about placing a few chests; this mod focuses on meticulously crafted environments, character interactions, and detailed animations to simulate the experience of intimacy and desire.

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Environments:**  The core of Jenny Mod is its dynamic environment system.  Instead of static, pre-defined chests, each chest has a unique, detailed scene within it - including:
    *   **Character Placement:**  The chest’s location dictates where the player will spawn, subtly influencing their initial placement and interaction with the environment.
    *   **Character Animation:**  Chest placement influences the animation of the character placed within.  Different chest arrangements create unique character gestures and postures.
    *   **Dynamic Lighting:**  Lighting is adjusted based on the chest’s contents and placement.  Dark, shadowy chests create a sense of mystery and anticipation, while brightly lit chests offer a feeling of warmth and excitement.
    *   **Ambient Sounds:**  Each chest has a unique ambient sound effect – a gentle stream, a crackling campfire, or a melodic tune – enhancing the atmosphere.
    *   **Inventory System:**  The inventory is heavily influenced by the chest's contents.

*   **Character Relationships:**  The mod encourages meaningful relationships between players and NPCs through the chest placement.  Players are encouraged to strategically place chests to influence NPC behavior and interactions.
*   **Animation System:**  A robust animation system allows for a wide variety of animations based on the chest's contents, the character's state, and the player's actions.
*   **Customizable Chests:**  Players can customize chests with different textures, block types, and even small decorative elements.
*   **Night Mode:**  A dedicated night mode that significantly enhances the visual appeal of the environment, with darker colors and more subtle lighting effects.
